Tactical view

-Player starts at one point on the map, can exit on several(maybe only one?)
-Entirely turn based

-Hex based map
  - Hexs each cost a "travel point" to move to
  - Navigation around this map similar to Civ
  - Winds and ocean currents can give a bonus or remove travel points
  - Some hexes have encounters on them(treasure chests/damaged ships/sea monsters)
  
-Combat?
  - Long ranged cannons can fire in this mode, but use cannon balls(limited resource)
-Ship
	- Part of the view will show a cross section of the ship
	- From this view the player will be able to manage the crew and reassign slots
